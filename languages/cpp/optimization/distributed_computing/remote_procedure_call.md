# Remote Procedure Call

A *remote procedure call* (RPC) is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is written as if it were a normal (local) procedure call.

RPC is a requestâ€“response protocol. An RPC is initiated by the client, which sends a request message to a known remote server to execute a specified procedure with supplied parameters. 
The remote server sends a response to the client, and the application continues its process.
