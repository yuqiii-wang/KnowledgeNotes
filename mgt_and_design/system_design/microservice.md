# Microservice

*Microservices* is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled services, where ideally, individual business functions are unilaterally linked individual components that can be easily removed/added/replaced.
It is the opposite to traditional monolithic software architecture where components are coupled with each other to deliver a business function.

* Microservice vs Servlet

Independence: Microservices are independently deployable and scalable services. Servlets are usually part of a monolithic web application and are not independently deployable.
