# Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)

The Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) is an open source software project managed by the Linux Foundation (initially launched in 2010 by Intel). 
It is basically an enhancement of many Linux modules for high performance computation, such as kernel bypass for fast network packet processing, CPU core affinity, TSC for timing, etc.

DPDK is built on Environment Abstraction Layer (EAL) that takes into consideration hardware architectures such as x86, that are collectively abstracted as unified APIs for use.
