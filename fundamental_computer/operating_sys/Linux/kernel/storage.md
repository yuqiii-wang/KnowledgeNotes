# Storage

## Page 

```cpp
struct address_space;
struct mem_cgroup;

/*
 * Each physical page in the system has a struct page associated with
 * it to keep track of whatever it is we are using the page for at the
 * moment. Note that we have no way to track which tasks are using
 * a page, though if it is a pagecache page, rmap structures can tell us
 * who is mapping it.
 *
 * If you allocate the page using alloc_pages(), you can use some of the
 * space in struct page for your own purposes.  The five words in the main
 * union are available, except for bit 0 of the first word which must be
 * kept clear.  Many users use this word to store a pointer to an object
 * which is guaranteed to be aligned.  If you use the same storage as
 * page->mapping, you must restore it to NULL before freeing the page.
 *
 * If your page will not be mapped to userspace, you can also use the four
 * bytes in the mapcount union, but you must call page_mapcount_reset()
 * before freeing it.
 *
 * If you want to use the refcount field, it must be used in such a way
 * that other CPUs temporarily incrementing and then decrementing the
 * refcount does not cause problems.  On receiving the page from
 * alloc_pages(), the refcount will be positive.
 *
 * If you allocate pages of order > 0, you can use some of the fields
 * in each subpage, but you may need to restore some of their values
 * afterwards.
 *
 * SLUB uses cmpxchg_double() to atomically update its freelist and counters.
 * That requires that freelist & counters in struct slab be adjacent and
 * double-word aligned. Because struct slab currently just reinterprets the
 * bits of struct page, we align all struct pages to double-word boundaries,
 * and ensure that 'freelist' is aligned within struct slab.

`address_space_operations` has methods operating the inode-mapped file, such as read/write.
