# EPS32

Compared to other microcontrollers, e.g., STM32, EPS32 (developed by Espressif Systems) is characterized by capabilities in Internet of Things (IoT), e.g., built-in bluetooth and wifi, and AI, e.g., SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and optimization for matrix multiplcation.

## EPS32 Variants

### ESP32 (Original)

Basic, features Xtensa LX6 CPU, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Classic, and BLE.

### ESP32-S Series

Offer improved performance, more peripherals, and enhanced AI features

#### ESP32-S3

CPU: Dual-core 32-bit Xtensa LX7 microprocessor, up to 240 MHz, with AI instruction extensions (vector instructions)

### ESP32-C Series

This series marks a shift in CPU architecture from Xtensa to RISC-V, aiming for a balance of cost-effectiveness, performance, and modern connectivity.

#### ESP32-C5

CPU: Single-core 32-bit RISC-V microprocessor, up to 240 MHz. (Also has a low-power 32-bit RISC-V CPU for certain tasks).

### ESP32-H Series

This series is highly specialized, moving away from Wi-Fi to focus entirely on IEEE 802.15.4-based mesh networking protocols.

### ESP32-P Series

High performance, multimedia-focused embedded processing, enhanced AI features
