# ESP32P4 Board and Relevant Components

## Common Basic Components

### UART, 

### EEPROM

EEPROM stands for Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory, a type of **non-volatile** memory chip to store **small** amount of data that persists even when power is off.

|Memory Type|Erasure Method|Erase Granularity|Write Cycles|Use Case|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|EEPROM|Electrical (on-chip)|Single byte|~100k–1M cycles|Small, frequent config updates|
|Flash|Electrical (block-based)|Large blocks (e.g., 4KB)|~10k–100k cycles|Firmware, bulk storage (SSDs)|
|ROM|Not erasable|N/A|0 (read-only)|Permanent code (e.g., BIOS)|
