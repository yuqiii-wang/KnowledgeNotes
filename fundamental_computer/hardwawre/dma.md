# Direct Memory Access (DMA)

Direct memory access, or DMA, is the advanced topic that completes our overview of memory issues. 
DMA is the hardware mechanism that allows peripheral components to transfer their I/O data directly to and from main memory without the need for the system processor to be involved in the transfer. 
Use of this mechanism can greatly increase throughput to and from a device, because a great deal of computational overhead is eliminated.
