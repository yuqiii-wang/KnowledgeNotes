# Display

## DCI Resolution

Cinema resolution standards set by Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI).

* DCI = 1K 1024(horizontal) x 540(vertical) = 552,960 pixels.
* DCI 2K = 2048 x 1080 = 2,211,840
* DCI 4K = 4096 x 2160 = 8,847,360
* DCI 8K = 8192 x 4320 = 35,389,440

## Colar Spaces

### CIELAB

CIELAB color space is a color space defined by the International Commission on Illumination (abbreviated CIE) in 1976.

L* for perceptual lightness and a* and b* for the four unique colors of human vision: red, green, blue and yellow.

#### CIEXYZ

The CIE 1931 color spaces (CIEXYZ) are the first defined quantitative links between distributions of wavelengths in the electromagnetic visible spectrum, and physiologically perceived colors in human color vision.

In CIEXYZ, Y is the luminance, Z is quasi-equal to blue (of CIE RGB), and X is a mix of the three CIE RGB curves chosen to be nonnegative.

#### CIERGB

CIERGB is standardized for defined red at wavelength $700$ nm, green at $546.1$ nm and blue at $435.8$ nm.

#### CIE and Gamut

*Color gamut* is a certain complete subset of a color space such as CIEXYZ or CIELAB.

For example, wide-gamut (WCG) RGB tech represents 77.6% of CIELAB, while sRGB tech covers only 35.9%.

### sRGB

sRGB is a standard RGB (red, green, blue) color space that HP and Microsoft created cooperatively in 1996.

### DCI-P3

DCI-P3 is an RGB color space first defined in 2005 as part of the Digital Cinema Initiative (DCI).
It is popular for video gaming and cinematic display.

DCI-P3 covers around 45% of the visible colours of the CIELAB colour space.
DCI-P3 is 26% larger than sRGB gamut.

## HDR

The High-Performance Monitor and Display Compliance Test Specification (DisplayHDR, or High Dynamic Range) from the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) defines the display industry's first fully open standard specifying HDR quality, including luminance, color gamut, bit depth, and rise time/latency to adjust color display.

HDR is a communications protocol.

Higher the HDR, more advanced display technology.

Brightness/Luminance is measured in cd/m2 (nit).

||Minimum Peak Luminance|Maximum Black Level Luminance|Gamut|
|-|-|-|-|
|DisplayHDR 400|400|0.4|sRGB|
|DisplayHDR 600|600|0.1|Wide Color Gamut (WCG)|
|DisplayHDR 1000|1000|0.05|Wide Color Gamut (WCG)|

### Dolby Vision

Dolby Vision is a high-end HDR-compatible display standard with enhancements, that allows for a maximum resolution of 8K, up to 12-bit color depth, maximum peak brightness of 10,000 nits, and requires minimum DisplayHDR 1000 hardware.
