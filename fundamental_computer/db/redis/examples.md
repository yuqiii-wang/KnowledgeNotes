## Autocomplete

In the web world, autocomplete is a method that allows us to quickly look up things that
we want to find without searching. Generally, it works by taking the letters that weâ€™re
typing and finding all words that start with those letters.

* Solution:

Use `LIST` to push/pop to add/remove recent searched words; Each item is a `String` so that substring compare can be used to match prefix.

## Cloud distributed locks

In Cloud app development, services are micro modules interacting with each other. There should be locks to prevent service-level concurrency.

* Solution:

Use `String` to set bool value to indicate if there is a lock.
