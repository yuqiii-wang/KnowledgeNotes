## Supervision and Non-Supervision Learning

* Supervision

* Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning is a special instance of weak supervision that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training.

* Non-Supervision Learning

## Normalization

* Min-Max-Scaling

Subtract the min value from each col's highest value, and divide by the range

* Standardization Scaling

Center a variable at zero and standardize the variance at one
