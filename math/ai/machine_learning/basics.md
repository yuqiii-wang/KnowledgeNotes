# Basic machine learning knowledge

## Cost vs Loss

The cost function measures the model's error on a group of objects, whereas the loss function deals with a single data instance.

## Supervision and Non-Supervision Learning

* Supervision

* Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning is a special instance of weak supervision that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training.

* Non-Supervision Learning

## Ablation

Ablation is the removal of a component of an AI system. An ablation study investigates the performance of an AI system by removing certain components to understand the contribution of the component to the overall system.
