# Full Parameter Finetuning

Fine tuning is used for large model to adapt small sample data based on pre-trained parameters.

Supervised vs Unsupervised Trainings:

* SFT: Supervised Fine-Tuning

Parameter trainings:

* From scratch: totally from random parameters
* Full-parameter fine-tuning: all parameter fine-tuning
* Parameter-efficient fine-tuning: only less than $10\%$ of parameters are put in training
