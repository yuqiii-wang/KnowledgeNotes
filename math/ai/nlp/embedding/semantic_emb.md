# Semantics/Linguistics

For example, the word "restaurants" has the below attributes:

* isNoun: $\{0, 0, 0, 1, 0\}$ for $\{\text{isVerb}, \text{isAdjective}, \text{isPronoun}, \text{isNoun}, \text{isAdverb}\}$
* isPlural: $\{1\}$ for $\{\text{isPlural}\}$  
* synonyms: $\{ 5623, 1850, 2639 \}$ (vocabulary index) for $\{ \text{hotel}, \text{bar}, \text{club} \}$
* antonyms: $\emptyset$
* frequent occurrences under what topics: $\{ 1203, 5358, 1276 \}$ (vocabulary index) for $\{ \text{eating}, \text{outing}, \text{gathering} \}$
* Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF): $\{ 0.016, 0.01, 0.0, 0.005 \}$ , formula:
  * $\text{TF-IDF}_j = \text{Term Frequency}_{i,j} \times \text{Inverse Document Frequency}_{i}$, where
  * $\text{Term Frequency}_{i,j} = \frac{\text{Term i frequency in document j}}{\text{Total no. of terms in document j}}$
  * $\text{Inverse Document Frequency}_{i} = \log \frac{\text{Total no. of documents}}{\text{No. of documents containing term i}}$

Given the four sentences/documents,

```txt
There are many popular restaurants nearby this church.
Some restaurants offer breakfasts as early as 6:00 am to provide for prayers.
"The price and taste are all good.", said one prayer who has been a frequent visitor to this church since 1998.
However, Covid-19 has forced some restaurants to shut down for lack of revenue during the pandemic, and many prayers are complained about it.
```

The TF-IDF per sentence/document is computed as below.

|No.|Token|Term count (Doc 1)|Term count (Doc 2)|Term count (Doc 3)|Term count (Doc 4)|Document count|IDF|TF $\times$ IDF (Doc 1)|TF $\times$ IDF (Doc 2)|TF $\times$ IDF (Doc 3)|TF $\times$ IDF (Doc 4)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|many|0.125|0|0|0.04348|2|0.301|0.038|0|0|0.013|
|2|popular|0.125|0|0|0|1|0.602|0.075|0|0|0|
|3|restaurants|0.125|0.07692|0|0.04348|3|0.125|0.016|0.01|0|0.005|
|4|nearby|0.125|0|0|0|1|0.602|0.075|0|0|0|
|5|church|0.125|0|0.04762|0|2|0.301|0.038|0|0.014|0|
|6|offer|0|0.07692|0|0|1|0.602|0|0.046|0|0|

For compression, one popular approach is encoder/decoder, where dataset is fed to machine learning study.

For example, by placing "restaurants" and "bar" together in a text dataset that only describes food, likely the attribute "topic" might have little information hence neglected (set to zeros) in embeddings.
