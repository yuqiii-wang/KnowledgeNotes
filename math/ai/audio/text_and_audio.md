# Text and Audio

## General Process and Terminologies

### Audio to Text (A2T) / Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

Process:

1. Noise reduction
2. Spectrogram Extraction
3. Acoustic feature extraction to identify basic sound units called phonemes
4. A language model takes the sequence of identified phonemes and figures out the most probable sequence of words, e.g., identify to/too/two by grammar.

### Text to Audio (T2A) / Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Process:

1. Text Preprocessing (Normalization): The model cleans the input text, expanding abbreviations ("Dr." -> "Doctor")
2. Linguistic Feature Generation: The model converts the text into a sequence of linguistic features (phonemes, stress, intonation)
3. Waveform Generation: A vocoder (voice coder) takes these linguistic features and synthesizes the final audio waveform.

### Audio Tasks

|Tasks|Model Architecture Type|Comments|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Audio-to-Text (Transcription)|Encoder-Decoder (or Encoder-only)|-|
|Text-to-Audio (Speech Generation)|Decoder-Only / Language Model-based|It treats audio generation like predicting the next "audio token" in a sequence; To synthesize intelligible, natural-sounding human speech.|
|Text-to-Audio (General Sounds)|Diffusion Models|To create any non-speech audio/foley, including sound effects, ambient noise, and music.|
|Audio-to-Audio (Translation/Editing)|Encoder-Decoder|-|
|Understanding Audio (Classification)|Encoder-Only|outputs a classification or embedding that can be used for search (embedding similarity) or analysis.|

where speech generation (TTS) vs general sound:

||speech generation (TTS)|general sound|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Description|To synthesize intelligible, natural-sounding human speech.|To create any non-speech audio/foley, including sound effects, ambient noise, and music.|
|Prompt and output|"Hello, how are you today?" -> "Good, thank you."|"A dog barking in the distance on a windy day." -> [waveform: dog barking]|
