## 3D Printing Filament Comparison Table

| Filament | Common Use Cases | Ease of Printing | Nozzle Temp (°C) | Bed Temp (°C) & Enclosure | Nozzle Impact (Wear) | Cautions, Fumes & Human Safety |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **--- STANDARD FILAMENTS ---** |
| **PLA** | Prototypes, decorative models, toys, general-purpose printing. | **Easy** | 190 - 220 | 50 - 60<br/>*No Enclosure Needed* | Standard Brass | **Safest.** Low fumes with a slightly sweet smell. Still requires good ventilation. |
|**PET**|Bottles, transparent parts (less common for printing).|Hard|230 - 260|80 - 110<br/>Enclosure Recommended|Standard Brass|**Safe** (fumes). Prone to crystallization if cooled improperly, making it brittle. More difficult to print than PETG. Hygroscopic.|
| **PETG** | Functional parts, mechanical components, food-safe containers (*see note*). | **Medium** | 230 - 250 | 70 - 85<br/>*Enclosure Recommended* | Standard Brass | **Very Safe.** Very low odor/fumes. Can be stringy. Hygroscopic (absorbs moisture). *Not food-safe after printing due to micro-gaps and nozzle contamination.* |
| **ABS** | Strong, durable parts that need heat resistance (e.g., car interior parts). | **Hard** | 240 - 260 | 95 - 110<br/>**Enclosure Required** | Standard Brass | **POTENTIAL HAZARD.** Releases strong, potentially toxic fumes (Styrene). **Requires excellent ventilation or filtration.** Prone to severe warping. |
| **--- ENGINEERING & HIGH-PERFORMANCE FILAMENTS ---** |
| **ASA** | Outdoor-use parts, automotive exteriors, items needing UV/weather resistance. | **Hard** | 240 - 260 | 95 - 110<br/>**Enclosure Required** | Standard Brass | **POTENTIAL HAZARD.** Similar to ABS, releases Styrene fumes. **Requires excellent ventilation or filtration.** Prone to warping. |
| **PC** | Extremely strong, heat-resistant, impact-resistant parts (e.g., drone frames). | **Very Hard** | 270 - 310 | 110 - 130<br/>**Enclosure Required** | Hardened Steel Recommended | **Moderate Hazard.** Can release fumes at high temps. **Extremely hygroscopic; must be kept dry.** Requires a high-temperature, all-metal hotend. |
| **PA (Nylon)** 聚酰胺/尼龙  | Gears, living hinges, tools, high-wear and high-fatigue functional parts. | **Hard** | 250 - 280 | 90 - 110<br/>*Enclosure Recommended* | Standard Brass | **Low Hazard (Fumes).** Generally low odor. **Extremely hygroscopic; must be bone-dry for printing.** Can warp. |
| **PP** | Chemical containers, living hinges, lightweight and tough applications. | **Very Hard** | 220 - 250 | 85 - 100<br/>*Enclosure Required* | Standard Brass | **Low Hazard.** Low odor. **Extremely difficult to print due to severe warping and poor bed adhesion.** Requires special bed surface (like packing tape). |
| **--- COMPOSITE FILAMENTS (-CF, -GF) ---** |
| **Composite**<br/>(e.g., PLA-CF, PETG-CF, PA-CF, ABS-GF) 复合碳纤维/玻纤 | Lightweight, high-stiffness structural parts, jigs, fixtures. | **Medium to Hard** | ~10-20°C higher than base material | Same as base material<br/>*Enclosure per base material* | **Hardened Steel REQUIRED** | **MODERATE HAZARD.** Combines fumes from the base plastic with **airborne abrasive micro-particles.** Excellent ventilation is crucial. **Highly abrasive to nozzles.** |
| **--- FLEXIBLE FILAMENTS ---** |
| **TPU** | Phone cases, gaskets, vibration dampeners, flexible-soled shoes. | **Medium** | 220 - 240 | 40 - 60<br/>*No Enclosure Needed* | Standard Brass | **Low Hazard.** Generally low odor. Can be difficult to feed into the extruder; requires slow print speeds. Prone to stringing. |
| **--- SUPPORT FILAMENTS (for dual-extruder printers) ---** |
| **PVA / BVOH** | Dissolvable supports for complex models with overhangs. | **Medium** | 190 - 220 | 50 - 60<br/>*No Enclosure Needed* | Standard Brass | **Safe.** Dissolves in plain water. Very hygroscopic and must be kept dry. Can be expensive. |
| **HIPS** | Dissolvable supports, typically used with ABS prints. | **Hard** | 230 - 245 | 95 - 110<br/>**Enclosure Required** | Standard Brass | **Solvent Hazard.** Dissolves in Limonene, a chemical solvent that requires gloves, eye protection, and very good ventilation during post-processing. |
| **--- OTHER SPECIALTY FILAMENTS ---** |
| **AERO**(e.g., PLA-AERO) 轻质化/发泡材料 | Lightweight parts with high stiffness-to-weight ratio (e.g., RC planes). | **Medium** | 230 - 270 | 50 - 70<br/>*No Enclosure Needed* | Standard Brass (unless composite) | **Low Hazard.** Foaming agent activates at high temps, releasing gas. Print in a well-ventilated area. Can be tricky to dial in settings. |
| **PCTG** | Tougher alternative to PETG for mechanical parts needing impact strength. | **Medium** | 250 - 270 | 80 - 90<br/>*Enclosure Recommended* | Standard Brass | **Very Safe.** Similar safety profile to PETG, with very low odor and fumes. |

where

*   **Ventilation:** Even "safe" filaments like PLA release ultra-fine particles (UFPs). It is **always recommended to print in a well-ventilated area.** For materials like ABS and ASA, excellent ventilation or an air filtration system is mandatory.
*   **Enclosures:** A 3D printer enclosure traps heat, which prevents warping in high-temperature materials and can help contain fumes and particles.
*   **Filament Dryness:** Many filaments are **hygroscopic**, meaning they absorb moisture from the air. Wet filament leads to poor print quality (stringing, weak parts, bubbles). Always store filament in a dry box and consider actively drying it before use, especially for materials like Nylon (PA), PC, and PETG.
*   **Temperatures:** The temperatures listed below are typical ranges. **Always check the manufacturer's specific recommendations** for the filament you are using.
