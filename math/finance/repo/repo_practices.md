# Repo Practices

## Repo Types

### Classic Repo

One party “sells” bonds to the other while simultaneously
agreeing to repurchase them or receive them back at a
specified future date.

Also known as allocation trade for bonds as the underlying security should be allocated.

### Hold-In-Custody (HIC) Repo

In a held-in-custody repo, the seller receives cash for the sale of the security, but holds the security in a custodial account (might not immediately accessible to the buyer) for the buyer. 
This type of agreement is even less common because there is a risk the seller may become insolvent and the borrower may not have access to the collateral.

### Tri-Party Repo

Tri-party repo is a type of repo contract where a third entity (apart from the borrower and lender), called a Tri-Party Agent, acts as an intermediary between the two parties to the repo to facilitate services like collateral selection, payment and settlement, custody and management during the life of the transaction.

Collateral is held in an independent third-party account.

The tri-party agent is also custodian, manages exchange of collateral and cash internally

Tri-party repo rate is usually higher than the delivery repo rate, but lower than HIC repo.

### Risk Remediation

* Formal binding legal agreements 

list obligations as much as possible to avoid unstated risks

* Default arrangements; netting 

if default happens, how to arrange collaterals to pay off borrowing
* Margining 

A discount of security fair value acted as a safe margin/buffer.

For example, settled collateral is worth of $100, a discount of 5% means lending $95 only.

## Trading and Hedging Strategies

* Yield Curve Arbitrage

Anticipated some securities' price might go up; some might go down.
Buy both so that future yield would be neutral to avoid drastic rises or falls in values.

* Credit Intermediation

Gov bonds usually have high credibility.
They can be used to hedge risks.

* Matched Book Trading

Make sure underlying securities have its value as stated by daily monitoring.

* Derivative Market Anticipation

Demand for short-term cash is often correlated to the derivative market.
High volatility market means that people are rush to raise funds to short/long derivatives.
