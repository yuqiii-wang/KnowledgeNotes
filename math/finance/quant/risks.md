# Risks

## Margin-at-Risk (MaR)

Margin-at-Risk (short: MaR) is a quantity used to manage short-term liquidity risks due to variation of margin requirements.

The MaR quantifies the "worst case" margin-call and is only driven by market prices.

## Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is a financial risk that for a certain period of time a given financial asset, security or commodity cannot be traded quickly enough in the market without impacting the market price.

## Liquidity-at-Risk (LaR)

Liquidity-at-Risk (short: LaR, not confused with liquidity risk) of a financial portfolio associated with a stress scenario is the net liquidity outflow resulting from this stress scenario:

    Liquidity at Risk = 
        Maturing Liabilities (repayment to borrowed money) 
        $+$ Net Scheduled Outflows (some planned payment to others) 
        $+$ Net Outflow of Variation Margin (short-term market fluctuations) 
        $+$ Credit-Contingent Cash Outflows (investor withdrawal when financial institutions have low credit)

If the Liquidity at Risk is greater than the portfolio's current liquidity position then the portfolio may face a liquidity shortfall.

### Stress Test

A stress test is an analysis or simulation designed to determine the ability of a given financial instrument or financial institution to deal with an economic crisis.

Gov plans for scenarios such as sudden drops of employment rate, interest rate rises, etc.

### Bank Stress Test

A bank stress test is a simulation based on an examination of the balance sheet of that institution.

## Value-at-Risk (VaR)

For a given portfolio, time horizon, and probability $p$, the $p$ VaR can be defined informally as the maximum possible loss during that time after excluding all worse outcomes whose combined probability is at most $p$. 
This assumes mark-to-market pricing, and no trading in the portfolio.

## Profit-at-Risk (PaR)

For example, if the confidence interval for evaluating the PaR is 95%, there is a 5% probability that due to changing commodity volumes and prices, the profit outcome for a specific period (e.g. December next year) will fall short of the expected profit result by more than the PaR value.
