where (in more detail)

* BVB is *Borrow vs Borrow*, basically a security exchange trade.

A security/stock loan fee, or borrow fee, is a fee charged by a brokerage firm to a client for borrowing security/stock. When a security is transferred as part of the lending agreement (Securities Lending Agreement (SLA) ), all rights are transferred to the borrower. This includes voting rights, the right to dividends, and the rights to any other distributions.

* BSB/SBB

Buy-sell back transaction (BSB) or sell-buy back transaction (SBB) means a transaction by which a counterparty buys or sells securities, commodities, or guaranteed rights relating to title to securities or commodities, agreeing, respectively,
to sell or to buy back securities, commodities or such guaranteed rights of the same description at a specified price on a future date,
that transaction being a buy-sell back transaction for the counterparty buying the securities, commodities or guaranteed rights, and a sell-buy back transaction for the counterparty selling them, such buy-sell back transaction or sell-buy back transaction not being governed by a repurchase agreement or by a reverse-repurchase agreement.
