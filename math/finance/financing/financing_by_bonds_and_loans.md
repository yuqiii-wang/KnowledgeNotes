## Financing Underlying Securities

### Bonds, Loans, and Fixed Incomes

* subprime mortgage 次级（房屋）贷款

A subprime mortgage is one that's normally issued to mortgage borrowers with low credit ratings.

* General collateral (GC)

Collateral that is not a specified security but of a defined homogenous credit quality.
for example UK gilts or AA-rated sterling Eurobonds.

* Bond 债券 vs Loan 借款

The issuer of a bond pays interest, and only interest regularly (usually semi-annually), and the principal is repaid at maturity in a lump sum.

For loans, payments are made including interests + principal, until principal is fully repaid. For example, mortgage receives monthly payment.

### Clearing

Clearing is the process that occurs after a trade is executed but before settlement.

Clearing prepares the transaction for settlement by confirming details and netting.

#### Clearing Facilities

* HKSCC (for securities)
* HKEX Clearing Limited (for derivatives)

### Settlement

Settlement is the final step in the transaction process, where the actual exchange of securities and funds takes place.

There are two types of payments:

* FOP (Free of Payment)

Free of payment is a settlement method for a securities transaction in which the delivery or reception of the securities is not linked to a corresponding transfer of funds.

* DVP (Delivery vs Payment)

Delivery versus payment (DVP) is a securities industry settlement method that guarantees the transfer of securities only happens after payment has been made.

#### Settlement Facilities

Often, a settlement facility is also a tri-party agent managing securities on behalf of financial institutions.

* CREST (Certificateless Registry for Electronic Share Transfer)
* HKSCC (for securities)

where (in more detail)

* BVB is *Borrow vs Borrow*, basically a security exchange trade.

A security/stock loan fee, or borrow fee, is a fee charged by a brokerage firm to a client for borrowing security/stock. When a security is transferred as part of the lending agreement (Securities Lending Agreement (SLA) ), all rights are transferred to the borrower. This includes voting rights, the right to dividends, and the rights to any other distributions.

* BSB/SBB

Buy-sell back transaction (BSB) or sell-buy back transaction (SBB) means a transaction by which a counterparty buys or sells securities, commodities, or guaranteed rights relating to title to securities or commodities, agreeing, respectively,
to sell or to buy back securities, commodities or such guaranteed rights of the same description at a specified price on a future date,
that transaction being a buy-sell back transaction for the counterparty buying the securities, commodities or guaranteed rights, and a sell-buy back transaction for the counterparty selling them, such buy-sell back transaction or sell-buy back transaction not being governed by a repurchase agreement or by a reverse-repurchase agreement.

## Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF, 中期借贷便利)

It is a key monetary policy tool used by China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), to manage liquidity in the banking system and influence interest rates.
While it remains a vital tool for injecting cash into banks, its function as the primary "price signal" (benchmark interest rate) is diminishing in favor of shorter-term rates.
