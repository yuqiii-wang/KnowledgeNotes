The Treasury and the Central Bank are separate entities. The Treasury manages all of the money coming into the government and paid out by it. The Central Bank's primary responsibility is to keep the economy stable by managing the supply of money in circulation (mostly buying/selling treasury bonds).

The Department of the Treasury manages federal spending. It collects the government's tax revenues, distributes its budget, issues its bonds, bills, and notes, and literally prints the money. 

The Treasury Department is headed by a Cabinet-level appointee who advises the president on monetary and economic policy.

* International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) 

An ISIN uniquely identifies a fungible security, such as 

Equities (shares, units, depository receipts)

Debt instruments (bonds)

Entitlements (rights, warrants)

Derivatives (options, futures)

Others (commodities, currencies, indices, interest rates)

* Prime Brokerage（主经纪商业务）

Prime brokerage is the generic name for a bundled package of services offered by investment banks, wealth management firms, and securities dealers to hedge funds which need the ability to borrow securities and cash for investment.

Different from financing for individual investors, prime brokerage targets hedge fund institutions.

* Rehypothecation （再抵押）

Rehypothecation is a practice whereby banks and brokers use, for their own purposes, assets that have been posted as collateral by their clients. 

In a typical example of rehypothecation, securities that have been posted with a prime brokerage as collateral by a hedge fund are used by the brokerage to back its own transactions and trades.

* Margin Call （追加保证金）

A margin call is an order from a broker to an investor, that demands that the investor place more money into their margin account.

* Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) 

SOFR is published by the New York Federal Reserve every business day for the previous business day. 
SOFR is a reference rate (that is, a rate used by parties in commercial contracts that is outside their direct control) established as an alternative to LIBOR. 

LIBOR is prone to error since it derives from calculations based on banks' survey, while SOFR reflects the real-time real world rates.

* Gilt (英国国债)

A gilt is a UK Government liability in sterling, issued by HM Treasury and listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The term “gilt” or “gilt-edged security” is a reference to its high credibility that the UK gov never failed to make interest or principal payments on gilts as they fall due. 

* Arbitrage (套利)

Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a difference in prices in two or more markets; striking a combination of matching deals to capitalise on the difference, the profit being the difference between the market prices at which the unit is traded. 

* Arbitrage Bond

An arbitrage bond is a debt security with a lower interest rate issued by a municipality prior to the call date of the municipality's existing higher-rate security.

* Underwriting (承销)

Financial institutions (acted as underwriter) guarantee payment in case of damage or financial loss and accept the financial risk for liability arising from such guarantee.

Underwriters purchase securities in bulk from issuers then distribute such securities to the public/clients.
Clients might or might not buy them from underwriters.
As a result, underwriters take risks when not having such securities sold; or earning underwriting spread if there is rise in security values.
