# Economics, Law and Finance Concepts

## Laws

* Legal Proceeding (通过法院)诉讼裁决

*Legal proceeding* is an activity that seeks to invoke the power of a tribunal in order to enforce a law.

* Interim Order 暂行法令

An order issued by a court during the pendency of the litigation.

* No Waiver of Rights 弃权/非弃权条款

This clause stipulates under what circumstances the behavior of a party can be considered giving up, or not giving up exercising rights or privileges.

Usually, agreements would have this clause "a failure or delay in exercising any right, pwoer or privileges will NOT to be presumed to operate as a waiver of rights" to make sure a party would NOT easily see its privileges forfeited.

* (Waiver of) Immunity from execution (不可)免执行条款

Out of law enforcement difficulties, e.g., trade settlements in different jurisdictions, or law enforcement is too expensive, there might be clauses stipulating under what conditions that a party can be exempted from law enforcement.

Often, in addition this provision provides in the case of law enforcement difficulties, what arbitration methods are to employ to resolve disputes by an impartial third party, and detailed delivery/settlement action.

### Legal Language

* Provisions vs Clauses 条款

* Pursuant to 根据(条款/证据)

To link a provision to another provision or to some factual matter.

### Legal Entities

* Legislator/Lawmaker and Legislature 立法

A legislator is an individual person who makes laws.
An organized group of legislators working together makes up a state's or country's legislature.

* Law Enforcement 执法(人员)

Activity to ensure laws are obeyed (by professionals).

* Plaintiff/Claimant 原告

A party who initiates a lawsuit.
If the party works for the government, it is called *prosecutor* 公诉人.

### Ways of Reaching Resolution

* Litigation

Take legal action going through the entire legal process surrounding disputes, such as filing a lawsuit, and pursuing it through the court system.

Mediation is even less formal than arbitration.

Arbitration may involve multiple arbitrators/people and often is a binding process; while mediation would just have one mediator/person handling a dispute, usually non-binding.

### Set-off/Netting 净额结算

*Set-off* or *netting* is a legal technique replacing gross positions with net positions between parties.

For example, party X and party Y have many transactions with each other trading securities under a master agreement.
When the agreement expires/ends, party X and party Y should see how much they owe to each other, ending the agreement with delivered securities and paid money, so that the party X and party Y combined total traded amount is "netted".

* Payment/Settlement Netting

*Payment netting* aggregates the amounts due between two parties and combines them into one payment for netting (normal netting).

* Close-Out Netting

Close-out netting involves (early) agreement termination events, such as a default or force majeure event.
Outstanding contracts are terminated at the time of its default, and contracted items are priced by Marked-to-Market (MTM) values.

### Capital Requirements

* Basel Accords

The Basel Accords are a series of three sequential banking regulation agreements (Basel I, II, and III) set by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (BCBS).

In the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse of 2008, Basel III was proposed to better regulate the banking industry, including methods such as requiring banks to have a minimum amount of common equity and a minimum liquidity ratio.

* Tier 1 Common Capital

Tier 1 common capital ratio is a measurement of a bank's core equity capital, compared with its total risk-weighted assets, and signifies a bank's financial strength. 

It is composed of weighted components such as cash, credit lines, mortgages and personal loans.

Investors are increasingly applying these non-financial factors as part of their analysis process to identify material risks and growth opportunities. 

## Auditing

* face/nominal/par value

Claimed value/price of a security by an authority. 

For example, one dollar of a nation's currency is worth of \$0.1 USD by face value (the value is traded via national banks and financial institutions, enforced by the government). However, if people are skeptical of this country's economic trajectory, in dark markets, people might actually trade by less than \$0.1 USD per one the nation's dollar (as actual/intrinsic value).

* EBITDA

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)

* depreciation vs amortization

Depreciation: a company's **tangible** fixed assets deteriorating over time, such as physical equipment.

Amortization: a company's **intangible** fixed assets deteriorating over time, such as patent lifetime.

* EBIT

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is a measure of a firm's profit that includes all incomes and expenses (operating and non-operating) except interest expenses (borrowed money cost) and income tax expenses.

EBIT = (net income) + interest + taxes = EBITDA - (depreciation and amortization expenses)

* due diligence （尽职调查）

[Law] Investigation out of legal/regulation requirements

[Finance] A comprehensive appraisal of a business undertaken by a prospective buyer, especially to establish its assets and liabilities and evaluate its commercial potential.

## Finance

### Identifier

* International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) 

An ISIN uniquely identifies a fungible security, such as 

Equities (shares, units, depository receipts)

Debt instruments (bonds)

Entitlements (rights, warrants)

Derivatives (options, futures)

Others (commodities, currencies, indices, interest rates)

* Stock Exchange Daily Official List (SEDOL)

SEDOL is a list of security identifiers used in the United Kingdom and Ireland for clearing purposes. The numbers are assigned by the London Stock Exchange.

### Banking

* bank run/run on the bank （挤兑）

A bank run or run on the bank occurs when many clients withdraw their money from a bank, because they believe the bank may cease to function in the near future.

* Gilt (英国国债)

A gilt is a UK Government liability in sterling, issued by HM Treasury and listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The term “gilt” or “gilt-edged security” is a reference to its high credibility that the UK gov never failed to make interest or principal payments on gilts as they fall due. 

* Demand deposit (活期存款)

Demand deposits or checkbook money are funds held in demand accounts in commercial banks.

* Traveller's cheque (旅行支票)

Before the age of credit card, cheque can be used to exchange for hard currency guaranteed by the credit of the cheque's issuer.
Nowadays, credit card almost replaces cheque.

* Savings account (儲蓄存款帳戶)

* Money market account (大额长期储蓄账户)

Require minimal saving amount and term; pay with high interests than that of saving account

* Certificate of deposit, CDs (大额存单)

CDs typically differ from savings accounts in that the CD has a specific, fixed term before money can be withdrawn without penalty and generally higher interest rates.

* Negotiable Certificate of Deposit (NCD) (可转让大额存单)

CDs are fixed of maturity and ownership.
NCDs are flexible in terms of maturity date, ownership and interest rate.

* Commercial Paper (商業票據)

Commercial paper is an unsecured promissory note with a fixed maturity of usually less than 270 days.
In layperson terms, it is like an "IOU" but can be bought and sold because its buyers and sellers have some degree of confidence that it can be successfully redeemed later for cash, based on their assessment of the creditworthiness of the issuing company.

For example, Apple bought some electronic devices from Foxconn.
Instead of just paying cash on goods' delivery, Apple pays with commercial paper that promises Apple will pay the full amount in 270 days.

### Secondary Market and Shares

* Preferred vs. Common Stock

The main difference between preferred and common stock is that preferred stock gives no voting rights to shareholders while common stock does.

Preferred shareholders have priority over a company's income, meaning they are paid dividends before common shareholders.

Common stockholders are last in line when it comes to company assets, which means they will be paid out after creditors, bondholders, and preferred shareholders.

* Exchange-traded fund (ETF)

ETFs own financial assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies, futures contracts, and/or commodities such as gold bars. 
The portfolios are published daily.

ETFs typically have short closure time (minimum holding period), and can be traded publicly.

### Interbank Rates

* Overnight (ON) Rate

Overnight rate is generally the interest rate that large banks use to borrow and lend from one another in the overnight market.

Implications:
Overnight rates are a measure of the liquidity prevailing in the economy. In tight liquidity conditions, overnight rates shoot up.
Central banks can stipulate overnight rate to control money supply.

There are many indecies/references of Overnight rates: LIBOR, EONIA, SOFR, SONIA, etc.

* LIBOR

The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is an interest-rate average calculated from estimates submitted by the leading banks in London. 

* EONIA

Eonia (Euro Overnight Index Average) is computed as a weighted average of all overnight unsecured lending transactions in the interbank market, undertaken in the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries by the Panel Banks

* Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) 

SOFR is published by the New York Federal Reserve every business day for the previous business day. 
SOFR is a reference rate (that is, a rate used by parties in commercial contracts that is outside their direct control) established as an alternative to LIBOR. 

LIBOR is prone to error since it derives from calculations based on banks' survey, while SOFR reflects the real-time real world rates.

* Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR)

the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) is the benchmark interest rate that lenders and borrowers use for interbank lending in the Hong Kong market.

* China Interbank Interest Rate

Offered by (China) National Interbank Funding Center.

* SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average)

SONIA is based on actual transactions and reflects the average of the interest rates that banks pay to borrow sterling overnight from other financial institutions and other institutional investors.

It is administered by Bank of England.

### Interest Rate

* Single Monthly Mortality Rate (SMM)

SMM is used to measure how much client has prepaid loan, and debtor will lose part of interest as income.

Suppose one month payment to debt is \$10,000 for a debt totalled \$100,000. However, client anticipated increased interest rate and would like to pay \$12000 this month.
The SMM is $2\%=\frac{12,000-10,000}{100,000}$ for this month.

### Underlying Asset

* Underlying asset

Most primitive securities that demonstrate value by itself, such as stocks, cash flow, commodity, etc, on which derivatives are formulated.

* collateral （抵押品）

Something pledged as security for repayment of a loan, to be forfeited in the event of a default, such as house ownership as collateral asking bank for a loan.

* Rehypothecation （再抵押）

Rehypothecation is a practice whereby banks and brokers use, for their own purposes, assets that have been posted as collateral by their clients. 

In a typical example of rehypothecation, securities that have been posted with a prime brokerage as collateral by a hedge fund are used by the brokerage to back its own transactions and trades.

* CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligation)

A complex structured finance product that is backed by a pool of loans and other assets and sold to institutional investors. Most typical are subprime securities made up of good and bad rating assets that triggered 2008 financial crisis.


* CLD (Currency Linked Deposit)

A currency-linked investment product is a structured investment product that consists of a time deposit (in the deposit currency) with currency option (derivatives).


* Delivery by Value (DBV)

DBV is a Euroclear UK and International collateral product that allows firms to borrow cash on a fully collateralised and secure basis.

The term "by value" means the used collateral's value is calculated by Euroclear UK and International via marked to market (MTM) high liquidity stocks and bonds.

### Funding

* broker （经纪人）

A person who buys and sells goods or assets for others.

* carry interest

Carry is a percentage of a fund's profits that fund managers get to keep on top of their management fees.

* pull the plug （撤资）

Withdraw funding

* Brokerage vs Over-the-counter

Two common ways to make a contract in search of a trading party: brokerage usually refers to exchange institutes; over-the-counter refers to dedicated one-time deal with big financial institutions. For example, bug banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase usually requires a contract worth over $1 billion prior to agreeing issuing an ISDA license for over-the-counter transactions. 

* Preferred vs Common stocks

A common stocks offers voting rights to shareholders and the issuer may choose to pay shareholders dividends.

A preferred stock pays stockholders set dividend payments on a regular schedule, but does not have voting rights or as much potential for capital appreciation as common stock.

* Prime

*Prime* generally refers to truthworthy clients.

For example, prime rate offers discounts in cost/interests for borrowing money.

* Prime Brokerage（主经纪商业务）

Prime brokerage is the generic name for a bundled package of services offered by investment banks, wealth management firms, and securities dealers to hedge funds which need the ability to borrow securities and cash for investment.

Different from financing for individual investors, prime brokerage targets hedge fund institutions.

* tranche

* loan vs bond （借款与债券）

Bonds are debt instruments/securities that can be traded; whereas loans are just debt.

* Margin Call （追加保证金）

A margin call is an order from a broker to an investor, that demands that the investor place more money into their margin account.

Usually, when an investor uses leverage (borrows money from a broker) to invest an asset, but this asset's value keeps decreasing, the broker demands this investor to put more money to his account to avoid forced closing position (平仓).

* Underwriting (承销)

Financial institutions (acted as underwriter) guarantee payment in case of damage or financial loss and accept the financial risk for liability arising from such guarantee.

Underwriters purchase securities in bulk from issuers then distribute such securities to the public/clients.
Clients might or might not buy them from underwriters.
As a result, underwriters take risks when not having such securities sold; or earning underwriting spread if there is rise in security values.

* Money market fund (货币基金)

A money market fund (also called a money market mutual fund) is an open-ended mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities such as US Treasury bills and commercial paper

* Fund of Funds (FOF)

A fund of funds (FOF) is a pooled fund that invests in other funds.

### Pledge, Hypothecation and Mortgage

|Pledge|Hypothecation|Mortgage|
|-|-|-|
|bailment of goods as security against the loan|pledge of an asset as collateral for a loan, without transferring the property's title to the lender|transfer of an interest in specific immovable property as security against loan|
|Movable (Gold, Jewellery, Stock, NSC etc.)|Movable (Vehicles, Stock and debtors.)|Immovable (example: house, land, etc.)|
|Possession remains with lenders|Possession remains  with borrowers|Possession remains  with borrowers|

### Money Supply

The money supply is the total amount of cash and cash equivalents such as savings accounts that is circulating in an economy at a given point in time.

The motivation of defining different supply scopes is to compute how much cash might be supplied to market.

||Description|Implications|
|-|-|-|
|M0|Notes and coins in circulation (outside Federal Reserve Banks and the vaults of depository institutions) (currency)||
|M1|M0 plus the amount of demand deposits, travelers checks and other checkable deposits + most savings accounts.||
|M2|M1 + money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds and certificates of deposit||
|M3|M2 + repos, commercial papers||

For $M2$ and wider scopes of money supply, securities as collaterals have such below money supply implications functioned as money lending.

For example, having $10\%$ of mandatory deposit giving $90\%$ money for lending, the lender after lending $90\%$ of money should receive collateral equivalent of the $90\%$, and this equivalent collateral can be again used to borrow $81\%=0.9 \times 0.9$ of the money.
As a result, the total theoretical money lending limit is (assumed total face value of $100$ at start)

$$
1000 \approx
100 \times 0.9 + 100 \times 0.9^2 + 100 \times 0.9^3 + ...
$$

### Financing, Loan and Bonds

* Equity 净值/权益

Equity (in accounting) is computed by subtracting liabilities from the value of the owned assets.

Equity in investment usually refers to shares of a company.

* Equity Financing vs Debt Financing 融资

To raise fund, equity financing needs equity (usually shares of a company) ownership transfer; debt financing does not need ownership transfer.

Debt financing usually needs collaterals (property, equipment, etc.) as insurance for borrowing.

* Tenor

Tenor refers to the length of time remaining before a financial contract expires.

* Loan Amortization (贷款定期偿还)

How periodic (usually by monthly) payment should be made to repay a loan.

$$
A=P\frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)-1}
$$

where

* $A$ periodic payment amount
* $P$ principle/initial payment
* $r$ interest rate
* $n$ total number of payments

### Trading and Market Info

Market moving information is a term used in stock market investing, defined as information that would cause any reasonable investor to make a buy or sell decision.


* Arbitrage (套利)

Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a difference in prices in two or more markets; striking a combination of matching deals to capitalise on the difference, the profit being the difference between the market prices at which the unit is traded.

In other words, buy low sell high.

In many scenarios, it refers to risk-free trade.

* Arbitrage Bond

An arbitrage bond is a debt security with a lower interest rate issued by a municipality prior to the call date of the municipality's existing higher-rate security.

## Organizations

* ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association)

* Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA)

A commodity trading advisor (CTA) is an individual or firm that provides personalized advice regarding the buying and selling of futures contracts, options on futures, and retail off-exchange forex contracts or swaps.

For example, CTA may offer a hypothetical market based portfolio designed to produce a high correlation to trend following managed futures strategies.

It is often getting compared with High Frequency Trading (HFT).
HFT and CTAs both use quantitative algorithms, but HFT is more about stock trading and being high frequency.

The U.S.: Federal Reserve

The U.K.: the Bank of England

Japan: the Bank of Japan

EU: the European Central Bank

The Central Bank's primary responsibility is to keep the economy stable by managing the supply of money in circulation (mostly buying/selling treasury bonds).

The Department of the Treasury manages federal spending. It collects the government's tax revenues, distributes its budget, issues its bonds, bills, and notes, and literally prints the money. 

The Treasury Department is headed by a Cabinet-level appointee who advises the president on monetary and economic policy.

It is a step for China to loosen capital controls and internationalize RMB.

* Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII)

A qualified domestic institutional investor or QDII is an institutional investor that has met certain qualifications to invest in securities outside of their home country.

Popular QDII programs come from the People's Republic of China, where the main regulatory body, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), at times grants a limited avenue for institutional investors to invest in foreign-based securities.
