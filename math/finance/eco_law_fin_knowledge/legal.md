### Civil

* Constructive Trust and Unjust Enrichment

Constructive Trust （建设性信托） is action for court to correct an unjust enrichment （不正当获利） case, or out of good conscience (好良心) consideration, to prevent a (often defendant) party from profiting from the (often plaintiff) another party through evil means, e.g., fraudulent.

For example, a local payment platform company (defendant) received a sum of money on behalf of a client (plaintiff) to purchase a vehicle from a car company. However, this car company went bankrupt after receiving money from the payment company, and the purchased vehicle is not delivered.
The plaintiff cannot reach out to the car company, but is able to sue the local payment company.

Court considers the defendant may not exercise duty of care （应尽责任） to investigate the car company's financial situation, and out of good conscience should compensate the plaintiff with some money.

If the payment company has already suspected the car company's financial health (this needs plaintiff provide evidence), but insisted on carrying on the payment in order to profit from this transaction, e.g., charge transaction fee, this amounts to unjust enrichment.

* Good Conscience （好良心） vs Good Faith （好信用）

Good faith is more about contract law that the contracted parties should be honest with the contract statements.

Good conscience is more about civil and moral judging.

* Balance of Convenience 便利之平衡

Balance of convenience is an important factor when court considers granting interim injunction （临时禁制令） to prohibit/demand defendant from/to take certain action.
Interim injunction is useful in scenarios when future lawsuit might take long time to reach resolution.

Balance of convenience demands court to balance the benefits of both and claimants as well as defendant.

Generally speaking, for claimant to acquire injunction, court needs to consider

-> necessity of granting the injunction, e.g., serious consequence if not granted
-> whether the claimant, if successful at trial, would be adequately compensated by damages
-> If either of the two previous issues are ambiguous, the court should consider where the balance of convenience lies.

Example: *American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd*

American Cyanamid claimed Ethicon's suture products breached their patent, and sought an interim injunction to stop the sutures being sold until the issues of infringement and validity could be determined at trial.

In the context of balance of convenience, court considers

-> The apparent merits of each party's case - but only if one party very clearly has a stronger case
-> The extent to which granting/not granting the injunction would affect each party
-> Whether the claimant would lose some or all of the value of a time-limited property right (such as a patent) if the injunction is not granted

### Criminal Accusation
