# Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) 

## Underlying Asset Types

* Fixed Income 

refers to those products that generate a fixed income as corporate and government bonds of different degrees (senior, high-yield, mezzanines), interest rate derivatives (CDS), or asset-backed securities (ABS);

* Currencies 

refers, not only to currencies, but also to all instruments that possess currencies as underlyings;

* Commodities 

includes different families of resources such as Energy (oil, natural gas, and electricity), Precious Metals (gold, silver, copper), Agricultural Commodities (like soybean which these days itâ€™s a major market talk as China is a major importer of US soybean), and Raw Materials. In addition, there are all derivatives used for hedging purposes (for example, a company that produces salt may purchase derivatives that mitigate or fully hedge the risk of a depreciation in salt prices).

## Reference Asset

A reference asset is an underlying asset used in credit derivatives to protect a debt holder against a potentially risky borrower. 
A reference asset is also known as a reference entity, a reference obligation.

* Example: Credit Default Swap (CDS)

A reference asset is a type of debt-backed security. 
To hedge against borrower default risk, the debt holder may enter into a credit derivative, such as a total return or a credit default swap (CDS), which is essentially an insurance covering the debt/borrower credit not going to default.
Borrower pays premium to a third party to insure the borrower's credit, that if the borrower fails to pay back, the third party insurance company needs to pay to the lender. 

## Trades

* Wash trade

*Wash trading* - also referred to as round trip trading - is a practice where investors buy and sell the same financial instruments almost at the same time.

For example, a bank group has many branches in different countries and regions. Bank HK wants to a trade from Bank HK to Bank JP, and this trade is called wash trade.

Motivations include security ownership change to another investor,
