# Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) 

* Fixed Income 

refers to those products that generate a fixed income as corporate and government bonds of different degrees (senior, high-yield, mezzanines), interest rate derivatives (CDS), or asset-backed securities (ABS);

* Currencies 

refers, not only to currencies, but also to all instruments that possess currencies as underlyings;

* Commodities 

includes different families of resources such as Energy (oil, natural gas, and electricity), Precious Metals (gold, silver, copper), Agricultural Commodities (like soybean which these days it’s a major market talk as China is a major importer of US soybean), and Raw Materials. In addition, there are all derivatives used for hedging purposes (for example, a company that produces salt may purchase derivatives that mitigate or fully hedge the risk of a depreciation in salt prices).

## Trades

* Wash trade

Wash trading – also referred to as round trip trading – is a practice where investors buy and sell the same financial instruments almost at the same time.

One major motivation is to manipulate market (often illegal) by first pumping up a security value by bulk buying, then bulk selling the security when its price is high. This pair of actions should finish within a short period of time.
