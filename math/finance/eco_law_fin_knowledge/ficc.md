# Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC)

## Security Types

Securities: fungible, negotiable financial instruments that hold some type of monetary value.

Other than most typical underlying asset such as cash flow, stock, commodity, they are more:

* Equity

An equity security represents ownership interest held by shareholders in an entity (a company, partnership, or trust), realized in the form of shares of capital stock.

* Debt/Bond

A debt security represents borrowed money that must be repaid, with terms that stipulate the size of the loan, interest rate, and maturity or renewal date.

* Asset-Backed Security (ABS)

A type of financial investment that is collateralized by an underlying pool of assets—usually ones that generate a cash flow from debt, such as loans, leases, credit card balances, or receivables.

Typical examples are Evergrand using future house selling receivables as guaranty (collateral) requesting for loans, a company taking its 1 year future revenues/profits as guaranty (collateral) requesting for urgent money.

* Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)

An investment similar to a bond that is made up of a bundle of home loans bought from the banks that issued them.

## Underlying Asset Types

* Fixed Income

refers to those products that generate a fixed income as corporate and government bonds of different degrees (senior, high-yield, mezzanines), interest rate derivatives (CDS), or asset-backed securities (ABS);

* Currencies

refers, not only to currencies, but also to all instruments that possess currencies as underlyings;

* Commodities 大宗商品

includes different families of resources such as Energy (oil, natural gas, and electricity), Precious Metals (gold, silver, copper), Agricultural Commodities (like soybean which these days it;s a major market talk as China is a major importer of US soybean), and Raw Materials. In addition, there are all derivatives used for hedging purposes (for example, a company that produces salt may purchase derivatives that mitigate or fully hedge the risk of a depreciation in salt prices).

## Reference Asset

A reference asset is an underlying asset used in credit derivatives to protect a debt holder against a potentially risky borrower. 
A reference asset is also known as a reference entity, a reference obligation.

* Example: Credit Default Swap (CDS)

A reference asset is a type of debt-backed security. 
To hedge against borrower default risk, the debt holder may enter into a credit derivative, such as a total return or a credit default swap (CDS), which is essentially an insurance covering the debt/borrower credit not going to default.
Borrower pays premium to a third party to insure the borrower's credit, that if the borrower fails to pay back, the third party insurance company needs to pay to the lender. 

## Trades

* Wash trade

*Wash trading* - also referred to as round trip trading - is a practice where investors buy and sell the same financial instruments almost at the same time.

For example, a bank group has many branches in different countries and regions. Bank HK wants to a trade from Bank HK to Bank JP, and this trade is called wash trade.

Motivations include security ownership change to another investor,

## Trading Platforms

* Exchange is a centralized platform for trading such as the New York Stock Exchange.

* Over-the-counter (OTC) is the process of trading securities via a broker-dealer network/private platform, e.g., bonds are traded in Bloomberg, and crypto currencies are traded in Binance.

* Private-negotiation is the agreement between two exclusive parties.
