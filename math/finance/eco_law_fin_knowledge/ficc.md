# Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) 

* Fixed Income 

refers to those products that generate a fixed income as corporate and government bonds of different degrees (senior, high-yield, mezzanines), interest rate derivatives (CDS), or asset-backed securities (ABS);

* Currencies 

refers, not only to currencies, but also to all instruments that possess currencies as underlyings;

* Commodities 

includes different families of resources such as Energy (oil, natural gas, and electricity), Precious Metals (gold, silver, copper), Agricultural Commodities (like soybean which these days itâ€™s a major market talk as China is a major importer of US soybean), and Raw Materials. In addition, there are all derivatives used for hedging purposes (for example, a company that produces salt may purchase derivatives that mitigate or fully hedge the risk of a depreciation in salt prices).
