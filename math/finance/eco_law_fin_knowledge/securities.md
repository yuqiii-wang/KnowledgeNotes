# Securities

A fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value.

## Security Types

Other than most typical underlying asset such as cash flow, stock, commodity, they are more:

* Equity

An equity security represents ownership interest held by shareholders in an entity (a company, partnership, or trust), realized in the form of shares of capital stock.

* Debt/Bond

A debt security represents borrowed money that must be repaid, with terms that stipulate the size of the loan, interest rate, and maturity or renewal date.

* Asset-Backed Security (ABS)

A type of financial investment that is collateralized by an underlying pool of assets—usually ones that generate a cash flow from debt, such as loans, leases, credit card balances, or receivables. 

Typical examples are Evergrand using future house selling receivables as guaranty (collateral) requesting for loans, a company taking its 1 year future revenues/profits as guaranty (collateral) requesting for urgent money.

* Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)

An investment similar to a bond that is made up of a bundle of home loans bought from the banks that issued them. Investors in MBS receive periodic payments similar to bond coupon payments. 

## Bonds, Loans, and Fixed Incomes

* subprime mortgage

A subprime mortgage is one that’s normally issued to borrowers with low credit ratings. 

* General collateral (GC)

Collateral that is not a specified security but of a defined
homogenous credit quality, for example UK gilts or AA-rated
sterling Eurobonds.

## Settlement Type

* FOP (Free of Payment)

Free of payment is a settlement method for a securities transaction in which the delivery or reception of the securities is not linked to a corresponding transfer of funds.

* DVP (Delivery vs Payment)

Delivery versus payment (DVP) is a securities industry settlement method that guarantees the transfer of securities only happens after payment has been made.
