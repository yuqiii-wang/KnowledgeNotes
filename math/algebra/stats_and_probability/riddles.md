# Probability, Combination and Permutation Riddles

* Given three lines/chords intersecting a circle, what is the expectation of one separated area; what is the average number of the separated areas ?

Answer: on this circle randomly pick up four points: $a,b,c,d$. There are three scenarios of how the four points having formed two chords.

* There are 100 points randomly scattered on a one-meter line and they are initialized randomly with movement direction either left or right. Points can only move either left or right on the line at a speed of 1 cm/second. If a points hits another point on the line, both points immediately move to the opposite directions. What is the expectation of total time that all 100 points leave from the line.
