# Dual Space

Any vector space $V$ has a corresponding dual vector space (or just dual space for short) consisting of all linear forms on $V$, together with the vector space structure of pointwise addition and scalar multiplication by constants.

Given any vector space $V$ over a field $F$,the (algebraic) dual space $V^*$ is defined as the set of all linear maps $\varphi : V \rightarrow F$. There exist the below mappings given the nature of linearity.
$$
\begin{align*}
(\psi+\varphi)(x) &= \psi(x) + \varphi(x)
\\
(\alpha \varphi)(x) &= \alpha \big(\varphi \big)(x)
\end{align*}
$$

The main difference in idea, put vaguely, is that fields are made of 'numbers' and vector spaces are made of 'collections of numbers' (vectors). You can multiply any two numbers together, and you can also take a collection of numbers and multiple them all with the same fixed number.
