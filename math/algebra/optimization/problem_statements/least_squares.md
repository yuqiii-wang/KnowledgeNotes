# Least Squares Problem

## Linear Least Squares Problem

We have a $m \times n$ linear system matrix $A$ and $m \times 1$ vector $\bold{b}$ such as
$$
A\bold{x}=\bold{b}
$$

If $m = n$, the solution is $\bold{x}=A^{-1}\bold{b}$ 

If $m > n$, there are more equations than unknown $\bold{x}$, solution to $\bold{x}$ is over-determined

If $m < n$, there are less equations than unknown $\bold{x}$, solution to $\bold{x}$ is under-determined
