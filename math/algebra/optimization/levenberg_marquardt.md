# Levenberg-Marquardt Method

It is used to solve the least-squares curve fitting problem:
given a set of $m$ empirical pairs $(x_i, y_i)$, where $x_i$ is independent while $y_i$ is dependent/observation, find the parameters $\beta$ of tthe model curve $f(x, \beta)$ so that the sum of the squares of the deviations $S(\beta)$ is minimized
