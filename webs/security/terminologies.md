# Some Terminologies

## CVE

**CVE**, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they mean a security flaw that's been assigned a CVE ID number.

## Hardening

**Hardening** is a process that prevents possible cyber attacks on servers, such as AMI.

Security group rules: A security rule applies either to inbound traffic (**ingress**) or outbound traffic (**egress**). 

## Log in vs Log on

Log in is a verb phrase. When you log in to something, you provide credentials to access material.

Log on is that, when you log on to something, you are simply accessing digital material, without necessarily needing to provide credentials.
